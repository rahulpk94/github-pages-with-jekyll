One of my favourite type of Blog is the “tech blog”.  Now this isn’t something new to blog about, 
as Tech bloggers have been blogging about 
technology news and gadget reviews in detail online since the beginning of the internet, 
But because it’s such a vast niche, you could carve out yourself a really good angle within the tech blog sphere. 
The trick is to have your own take on tech and don’t just follow the trend. 
One area which hasn’t really been covered specifically is eco tech,
so something to think about. Maybe a blog specifically covering tech 
aimed at becoming more environmentally conscious.

Anyway, here’s a few blogs in the tech niche that I really like and that I feel are doing something different and is thriving when it comes to organic traffic increases and revenue.
